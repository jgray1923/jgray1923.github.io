# About Jen

### Previous Education
I graduated from my undergraduate BSc Geography degree with an Upper-Class second honors in 2015, from Sheffield Hallam University.
My dissertation *An Investigation on the Barriers Affecting Access to and Engagement with Local Green Spaces* comprised of a case study
in which several qualitative research methods including focus groups and interviews, and a quantitative method of site observations, in 
categorising and tallying the greensapce users were used. More information regarding this piece of research can be found in **projects**.

Following on from my BSc I undertook my MSc, again at Sheffield Hallam University in Geographical Information Systems, 
in which I graduated with a distinction in 2017. My Major Research Proposal entitled *Critically Evaluating the ANGSt Model* was a qualitative mixed-methods
piece of research. Research methods included semi-structured interviews, policy evaluations, and upskilling into Python programming for computer modelling within ArcGIS. Again more information regarding this piece of research can be found in **projects**.

### Current Education
I started my Itegrated PhD *'Predictive Geodemographics'* September 2017, in which I am completing another MSc in Data Analytics and Society (current projects within this masters can be found in **MSc**). 
What drew me to this 'Predictive Geodemographics' PhD was the geographical perspective of geodemographics in which 
I have lots of understanding of, and work with within my MSc, and the technical programming perspective of the modelling. 
My desire to develop a model was fuelled by my MSc, as I initially planned on developing a fully automatic ANGSt analysis model, 
but within the remits of an MSc, a semi-automatic methodology was developed instead.
