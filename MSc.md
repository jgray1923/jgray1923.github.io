### Programming for Social Science

Programming for Social Science was the first module of the MSc, conducted as an intense, week long module in which we, with the guidance of [Andy Evans](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.evans), developed an agent-based model.
The ABM consisted of agents (sheep), each interacting with each other and their environment (a 300x300 grid). Interactions included movements, grazing the environment, sharing their store (eaten food) with other sheep within their neighbourhood, and also being sick if they were too greedy!

The first assignment for this modules therefore includes an [online portfolio](https://github.com/jgray1923/Portfolio) of the above ABM, 
and the creation of a series of web pages. These GitHub Pages were written in Markdown, but [these](https://github.com/jgray1923/WEBPRACTICEjgray1923.github.io)
were written in and display my (fairly limited!) knowledge of HTML.
