## PhD Project
My PhD project will aim to create a dynamic, predictive geodmeographic classification system, in which will have the ability to predict the social
trajectory of individuals throughout their lifetimes, via a hierarchical classification model. 
Such a model will support lifetime evaluations of the geodemographic segment migration of both consumers and cizitens. 'Predictive Geodemographics' is in
partnership with CallCredit, developers of geodemographic classification system, CAMEO. 

I am privileged to be supervised by [Lex Comber](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/a.comber) in the School of Geography, and [Lisa Buckner](http://www.sociology.leeds.ac.uk/people/staff/buckner) in the School of Sociology.
