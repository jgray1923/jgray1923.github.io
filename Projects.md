### BSc Geography - Dissertation

This research was based upon a case study of Martinwells Lake at Edlington, Doncaster. A serious incident occured at location in 2009,
and this research aimed to understand the barriers to access and engagement with this local greenspace. Findings concluded that there were
many barriers to engagement with the site, including physical (poor entrance sites, uneven terrain unsuitable for pushchairs and mobility scooters), 
social (antisocial behaviour at location, fear of personal security). 

Women were much more effected by barriers, the prominant being the fear for their personal security. Recommendations for improvement included current users of the site
(eg. fishermen and dog walkers) to report any antisocial behaviour, and local 

### MSc GIS - Major Research Project

This research was an extension of my BSc dissertation, critically evaluating access via the ANGSt standards within Yorkshire and the Humber. However, this research with being GIS, focussed upon modelling and improving such standards, thus access to greenspaces. This research found that local authorities within Yorkshire and the Humber often do not implement ANGSt as a standalone standard, rather alongside other national standards to improve ease of implementation. Furthermore, buffer methodology vastly overestimated access to larger greenspaces, whilst underestimating access to smaller greenspaces within closer proximity. The network analysis methodology is much more efficient in providing accurate assessments of greenspace accessibility.

Recommendations for improvement include an update to the ANGSt standards, including a quality of access standard, and thresholds or minimum targets
for each standard. Also, Python programming within ArcGIS vastly increases modelling accuracy and efficiency, and should be implored within
local authority greenspace analyses.
