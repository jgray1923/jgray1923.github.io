Webpage
A series of webpages created as part of my GEOG5995 Assignment 1. These webpages have various pieces of information regarding my PhD project, 
my MSc and associated projects (ie. this one!), previous education and research projects. My GEOG5995 Assignment 1 is avialable to view
within the links given in MSc.md. 'online portfolio' link. These pages were written fairly easily in Markdown, but examples of
my HTML coding are given in the 'these' links in MSc.md. (as the markdown webpages look more professional, but the HTML writing feels more 
rewarding!)
