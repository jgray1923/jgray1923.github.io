## Hi, I'm Jennie.

I'm currently a first year integrated PhD student upon the newly formed Data Analytics and Society CDT. My programme includes a part-time MSc in Data Analytics and Society over the first two years, running along side my 4 year PhD 'Predictive Geodemographics'. More information regarding my PhD can be found [here](PhD.md). 


I am based in the [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics](www.lida.leeds.ac.uk) (LIDA), at the Worsley Building of the [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/).
